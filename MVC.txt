Model Interface => The inteface which is used for transferring the required data
from controller part to view part.

In order to do so we use two attributes of the model interface
1. addModel attribute, used to bind the required object with model attributes name.
2. @ModelAttribute, used to bind a method parameter or method return value to the named model attribute.

P.S => The object here will be created here first EX:
Details detail = new Details();
model.addAttribute("detail", detail);
